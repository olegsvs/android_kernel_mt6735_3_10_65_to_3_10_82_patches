Subject: [PATCH 0629/1168] arm: KVM: force execution of HCPTR access on VM
 exit

commit 85e84ba31039595995dae80b277378213602891b upstream.

On VM entry, we disable access to the VFP registers in order to
perform a lazy save/restore of these registers.

On VM exit, we restore access, test if we did enable them before,
and save/restore the guest/host registers if necessary. In this
sequence, the FPEXC register is always accessed, irrespective
of the trapping configuration.

If the guest didn't touch the VFP registers, then the HCPTR access
has now enabled such access, but we're missing a barrier to ensure
architectural execution of the new HCPTR configuration. If the HCPTR
access has been delayed/reordered, the subsequent access to FPEXC
will cause a trap, which we aren't prepared to handle at all.

The same condition exists when trapping to enable VFP for the guest.

The fix is to introduce a barrier after enabling VFP access. In the
vmexit case, it can be relaxed to only takes place if the guest hasn't
accessed its view of the VFP registers, making the access to FPEXC safe.

The set_hcptr macro is modified to deal with both vmenter/vmexit and
vmtrap operations, and now takes an optional label that is branched to
when the guest hasn't touched the VFP registers.
