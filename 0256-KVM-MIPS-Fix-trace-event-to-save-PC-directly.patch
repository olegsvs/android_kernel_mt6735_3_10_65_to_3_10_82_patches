Subject: [PATCH 0256/1168] KVM: MIPS: Fix trace event to save PC directly

commit b3cffac04eca9af46e1e23560a8ee22b1bd36d43 upstream.

Currently the guest exit trace event saves the VCPU pointer to the
structure, and the guest PC is retrieved by dereferencing it when the
event is printed rather than directly from the trace record. This isn't
safe as the printing may occur long afterwards, after the PC has changed
and potentially after the VCPU has been freed. Usually this results in
the same (wrong) PC being printed for multiple trace events. It also
isn't portable as userland has no way to access the VCPU data structure
when interpreting the trace record itself.

Lets save the actual PC in the structure so that the correct value is
accessible later.
