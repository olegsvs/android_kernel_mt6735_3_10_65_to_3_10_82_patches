Subject: [PATCH 0280/1168] dm io: reject unsupported DISCARD requests with
 EOPNOTSUPP

commit 37527b869207ad4c208b1e13967d69b8bba1fbf9 upstream.

I created a dm-raid1 device backed by a device that supports DISCARD
and another device that does NOT support DISCARD with the following
dm configuration:

 #  echo '0 2048 mirror core 1 512 2 /dev/sda 0 /dev/sdb 0' | dmsetup create moo
 # lsblk -D
 NAME         DISC-ALN DISC-GRAN DISC-MAX DISC-ZERO
 sda                 0        4K       1G         0
 `-moo (dm-0)        0        4K       1G         0
 sdb                 0        0B       0B         0
 `-moo (dm-0)        0        4K       1G         0

Notice that the mirror device /dev/mapper/moo advertises DISCARD
support even though one of the mirror halves doesn't.

If I issue a DISCARD request (via fstrim, mount -o discard, or ioctl
BLKDISCARD) through the mirror, kmirrord gets stuck in an infinite
loop in do_region() when it tries to issue a DISCARD request to sdb.
The problem is that when we call do_region() against sdb, num_sectors
is set to zero because q->limits.max_discard_sectors is zero.
Therefore, "remaining" never decreases and the loop never terminates.

To fix this: before entering the loop, check for the combination of
REQ_DISCARD and no discard and return -EOPNOTSUPP to avoid hanging up
the mirror device.

This bug was found by the unfortunate coincidence of pvmove and a
discard operation in the RHEL 6.5 kernel; upstream is also affected.
