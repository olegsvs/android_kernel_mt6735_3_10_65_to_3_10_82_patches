Subject: [PATCH 0110/1168] ARM: 7931/1: Correct virt_addr_valid

commit efea3403d4b7c6d1dd5d5ac3234c161e8b314d66 upstream.

The definition of virt_addr_valid is that virt_addr_valid should
return true if and only if virt_to_page returns a valid pointer.
The current definition of virt_addr_valid only checks against the
virtual address range. There's no guarantee that just because a
virtual address falls bewteen PAGE_OFFSET and high_memory the
associated physical memory has a valid backing struct page. Follow
the example of other architectures and convert to pfn_valid to
verify that the virtual address is actually valid. The check for
an address between PAGE_OFFSET and high_memory is still necessary
as vmalloc/highmem addresses are not valid with virt_to_page.
